Introduction
============

[Iodine](https://sintrastes.github.io/Iodine/) is a functional UI toolkit for Kotlin built on top of [Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html), [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), and [Arrow](https://arrow-kt.io/). Where Arrow intends to be a "Functional companion to Kotlin's Standard Library", Iodine aims to be a functional companion to Jetpack Compose (including for [desktop](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-jb) and multi-platform). 

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This project is currently alpha quality software. Things may break.
 Interfaces are likely to change without notice or deprecation cycles between versions. Documentation may not be entirely accurate or complete. While Iodine could very well be used today to build applications, at this time we do not recommend it for production use.

Why use Iodine?
---------------

A question that might come to mind when first learning about Iodine is: What advantages does it provide over pure compose? Isn't compose already a perfectly good declarative UI framework, why do we need another layer on top of that?

The answer to that is multi-fold:

  1. Iodine, together with some [other projects](), provides the capability to easily create and use [forms](https://sintrastes.github.io/Iodine/concepts/forms_and_profunctors/)
    for the validation and entry of Kotlin data classes.
  2. Iodine provides various utility functions for common UI and databinding patterns, such as a drop-down list selection widget which displays some visual representation (say a name) of a more complex strucuted object that is being selected under-the-hood.
  3. Iodine builds on top of composable functions to allow architecting user interfaces in terms of _components_, which allows explicitly specifying
    how the state of the component updates based on the _input events_ to the component, as well as what kind of events the component itself can output, and
    provides a useful re-usable/plugable bundle of UI and buisness logic (similar to [Decompose](https://github.com/arkivanov/Decompose)) which still internally maintains
    a clear seperation of presentation (view) and buisness logic.
  5. The explicit specification of the API of components that Iodine allows allows for highly flexible ways of abstracting out various
     UI design patterns to reduce coupling between different aspects of the UI design, as well as allowing for particularly nice APIs
     to be designed for plugin systems where the UI of a base application is extensible by said plugins.
  6. Iodine's architecture allows for [particularly easy](https://sintrastes.github.io/Iodine/concepts/comonadic_components/#testing-a-comonadic-api) testing of UI logic.

‚úèÔ∏èGetting Started
--------------------

To get started with Iodine, clone this project and run `gradlew :core:jar :desktop:jar` 
 to build the `iodine-core` and `iodine-desktop` `jar`s needed for a Compose for Desktop 
 project, then, place these in the `libs` folder of your project, and add the following 
 to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation(files("$projectDir/libs/iodine-core.jar"))
    implementation(files("$projectDir/libs/iodine-desktop.jar"))
    ...
}
```

An example of this can be found in the [compose for desktop project example](examples/desktop_example).

Similarly, to get started with an Android project, you can run `gradlew :core:jar :android:build`,
 place the built jar and aar in the `libs` folder of your project, and add the following
to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation(files("$projectDir/libs/iodine-core.jar"))
    implementation(files("$projectDir/libs/iodine-android.aar"))
    ...
}
```

An example of this can be found in the [android project example](examples/IodineAndroidApp).
